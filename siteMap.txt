0. Finimatic Positioning (simple language)

Who you’re for:
Finance YouTubers with an existing offer (course/membership/newsletter) doing regular macro / market analysis.

What you do in one line:

Finimatic installs an AI-powered scripting + animation system that turns your raw market videos into high-retention, revenue-focused content — without you writing scripts from scratch or waiting weeks for an editor.

Unique angle vs typical editors:

AI scripting system (not just “we edit videos”)

Chart animations built for CTAs + funnels, not just views

Faster turnaround because infra is built

This is the spine of your website + emails.

1. Landing Page Structure for Finimatic

Think: one clean scroll page, no fluff, built for cold email clicks.

Section 1 – Hero

Goal: Instantly tell a finance creator: “This is for you.”

Layout:

Left: Headline + subhead + CTA button

Right: Short looping GIF of a chart animation / script UI or a thumbnail wall

Sample copy:

Headline (safe version):

Turn Your Market Videos Into a 24/7 Sales Asset

Subhead:

Finimatic builds an AI-powered scripting + animation system for finance creators. You record your usual macro or market update; we turn it into high-retention animated videos with clean CTAs that grow your email list and sell your course or membership.

Primary CTA button:

“See a breakdown & book a call”

Secondary link (text):

“Watch a 3-minute example”

Section 2 – Who This Is For (Filter)

Goal: Make the right people feel “oh, that’s me.”

Bullet it:

Finimatic is built for:

Finance YouTubers with 10K+ subs

You have a course, membership, or paid newsletter (not just AdSense)

You already publish weekly market / macro videos

You’re busy and don’t want to spend 5–10 hours scripting + managing editors

Not a fit if:

You don’t have any product or offer yet

You’re looking for shorts-only editing

You want a full “grow my channel from zero” service

Short, honest, filters well.

Section 3 – The Core Promise + Unique Mechanism

Frame it like Austin’s “promise + unique mechanism” thing.

Section title:

What Finimatic Actually Does

Left – Outcome bullets:

When we work together, our goal is simple:

Turn your weekly macro video into a tight 5–12 minute animated asset

Make that video sell your offer clearly (email opt-ins + checkouts)

Systemize this so it happens every week without you rewriting scripts

Right – Unique Mechanism (name it):

The Finimatic Content Engine™
A three-part AI content system:

Script Engine – turns your raw talk-to-camera or livestreams into structured, on-brand scripts with CTAs built for your funnel.

Chart Animation Layer – clean, data-first visuals that make your frameworks easy to understand and rewatch.

Revenue Tracking Hooks – UTM-tagged links + simple reporting so we can compare:

“Normal video” vs “Finimatic video” → email signups + sales.

You’re not claiming magic, you’re describing a system.

Section 4 – “How It Works” in 4 Simple Steps

Keep process ultra clear.

How a Typical Week Works

You record as usual
Your macro update / market analysis / educational video.

We run it through the Finimatic Script Engine
We condense, restructure and add CTAs aligned with your course / membership.

We produce the animated version
Charts, flows, key levels, and transitions handled by my team (no new tool learning for you).

We plug in tracking & send a simple report
Each Finimatic video uses unique UTM links, so over time you’ll see:

viewers → email leads

email leads → sales

Callout box under this:

You keep final cut.
You can review every script and video before it goes live.

Section 5 – Proof / Case Studies (with your constraints)

You said:

You don’t yet have clean "Finimatic only" case studies

You do have:

Past work that generated ~150M views (shorts + content)

Current creators with solid engagement + watch time

External benchmarks like Bravo’s Research and EPP Research

We’ll use 3 layers of proof:

5.1 Your personal track record

Small strip:

Backed by years inside the finance creator world

Helped creators generate 150M+ views across short-form + long-form content

Built AI scripting systems that now produce videos in days instead of weeks

Working hands-on with finance educators who sell $1,500–$2,000/year programs

(That’s all true and non-hype.)

5.2 “This Is What ‘Winning’ Looks Like in Your Niche” (external channels)

Important: do NOT imply they’re your clients. Make it explicit.

What Good Looks Like (Inspiration, Not Clients)
Channels like Bravo’s Research and EPP Research have proven there’s huge upside in:

clear, data-driven storytelling

strong chart explainer visuals

consistent CTAs into a paid research product

On our calls, I’ll show how Finimatic’s system is built to move you in that direction, using your frameworks and your voice.

You can screenshot their channels with a small label under each image:

“Inspiration example – not a Finimatic client.”

5.3 Light “results” from your current work

Pick 1–2 numbers you actually have:

“Example: 2.5K-view animated video → 116 hours watch time (46%+ avg view duration).”

“Email signups noticeably up on videos with structured CTAs (client feedback), now being tracked via dedicated UTM links.”

You can show simple graphs/screens:

YouTube Analytics retention curve

Screenshot of client saying “love the CTAs, we’re getting subscribers”

Even if not perfect attribution, frame it honestly:

“These are early signals from channels using the Finimatic approach. We’re now adding full tracking to get hard revenue numbers.”

Section 6 – Packages (High-Level)

Don’t overcomplicate. Two options like Austin said.

Ways to Work Together

Done-For-You Finimatic Content Engine (Agency)

We handle scripting, animations, and tracking for 2–4 videos/month

Best for creators already selling a course/membership who want to save time and push revenue

Done-With-You Implementation (Consulting)

8–12 week sprint to install your own AI scripting + content system

You or your team produce the videos; we give you the prompts, templates, and review

Below this:

Pricing is custom based on volume and complexity. Most creators start between $X–$Y per month for DFY.
You can leave numbers blank in public and talk money on the call, or put a range like $2–5K/month DFY, $1.5–3K for DWY.

Section 7 – Simple FAQ

Keep it short, answer objections:

“Do I have to change my whole content style?”

“What if I already have an editor?”

“Can we test this on one video first?”

“Will AI make my content feel fake?”

Quick answers like:

“We work on top of your existing style and editor. Think of Finimatic as the brain + blueprints that feed your creative machine.”
