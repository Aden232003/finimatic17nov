The Creator Revenue Engine (AI Ops Layer)

Four stages. One system.

1) Acquire — Content that attracts the right buyers

Weekly market/content intel (what’s working + why)

Hook + angle generation

Repurposing plans (long → short → email → posts)

Script + outline assistance in your voice

2) Convert — Turn conversations into booked calls

AI “setter assist” (draft replies + follow-up prompts + next-best-message)

Lead tagging + lightweight scoring

Auto reminders + scheduling flow support

Objection handling assist during calls (optional)

3) Deliver — Better client experience with less admin

Auto-send recordings, summaries, action items after calls

Onboarding sequences + check-ins

Content delivery / feedback loops organized

Client / student support workflows

4) Retain — Community systems that compound

Welcome flows + nudges

Weekly prompts + announcements

Q&A triage + “what should I respond” drafting

Campaign workflows for workshops / launches

Translation: You do the creative + the relationships. The system handles the repetition.

SECTION: “How it works” (keep it clean like your current 3-step)
How It Works

Step 1 — Systems Audit (20 mins)
We map your funnel: where leads come from, where they drop, what’s manual, what’s expensive.

Step 2 — Install 1–2 automations first (Sprint)
We build the highest-leverage pieces first (usually conversion + delivery ops).

Step 3 — Iterate monthly (Retainer)
We expand the system: more agents, better training data, smoother workflow, stronger conversion.
